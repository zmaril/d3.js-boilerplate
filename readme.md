# d3.js boilerplate

d3.js boilerplate is an opinionated template system designed to help
you build a sophisticated data driven document as fast as possible. By
providing a full featured template and encouraging the use of useful
tools, this project aims to help developers passively and actively cut
down on development time.

This is the big productive brother of
[Visulization Data](https://github.com/zmaril/Visualization-Data).

## How it works

d3.js boilerplate is a system that changes as your data
visualization needs do. The idea is to checkout the git branch
that best matches your needs.

Examples:

jquery-ui and d3.js together on a single page? `git checkout jquery-ui`
Only need d3.js? `git checkout basic`

## General usage

Unless otherwise specified, each branch has the following files:

### HTML

* index.html

### Coffeescript/Javascript

* js/index.coffee
* js/d3.v2.min.js
* js/jquery.min.js
* js/underscore.min.js

### less/CSS

* css/index.less

[Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/),
[{less}](http://lesscss.org/), and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)
use are encouraged to speed up development and deployment. Learning
how to use these technologies within this context will save you a ton
of time.

## Branches

Checkout each branch on github to see how to develop and deploy each
specific branch.

* [basic](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate/tree/basic) - only has d3.js installed.
* [jquery-ui](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate/tree/jquery-ui) - A simple example of how to use jquery-ui to interact
  with d3.js.
* [backbone](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate/tree/backbone)- Deeplinking d3.js with backbone.
* [bootstrap](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate/tree/bootstrap) - Pretty pages!
* [dashboard](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate/tree/dashboard)  - Creating a dashboard with d3.js, bootstrap, and backbone.

### Current Major TODOS
* Try to scale MathJax down some. It's huge. Only the SVG components
  are used, so everything else can fall away. _This will be moved to
  the MathJax branch once it gets made. But the files do slow down
  cloning, and thus the point of the project, pretty hard most of the
  time._
* Add in more branches. Ideas: rickshaw, cubism, MathJax - Interactive
  graphics with Latex annotations, crossfilter - How to throw around
  millions of data points, graphene - Customizing graphene,
  investigator - A bootstrap backed website that builds on rickshaw,
  jquery-ui, underscore, and backbone to provide a jumping off point
  for designing your own data investigator.
* Get a better website set up to view all this all pretty like. Use [sandcastle](https://github.com/Khan/sandcastle).
